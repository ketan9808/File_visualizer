# belles id√©es (French for beautiful insights)
This project started with the aim of renaming and rearranging movies in sequential manner of folder and subfolders. but as i was developing the software i thaught of creating a software that will provide useful insights about a folder and subfolders or even whole drive. The insights will be created using matplotlib and seaborn i will try to create a desktop version for all operating system. The folders and subfolders will be analyzed on the basis of the metadata of the file provided.

# Movie Manager
The movie manager function of the program is ment to rearrange the movies into folders and subfolders. The additional functionality of renaming of the mass of video files will also be available. The insight will also tell us about similar movies with respect to name or size or both. The use of IMDB API can be used to check the names of the movies and rename them accordingly.

# Insights
The insights will be provided for a selected folder and the insight will show the major file types and space occupied. these can be rearranged using any of the variables either space or type or both.


# Version Available
I am trying to make 3 version of the software.
- GUI version
- CLI version
- Simple python program
- Anybody who want to create a java version of the same can create and send me pull request for the same.

Also i will try to create a project webpage in collaboration with other people.
