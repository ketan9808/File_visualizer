# Movie Name Manager

I use to have a lot of videos which are unorganized, some of them are with subtitles and others without subtitls. so with the help of this project I will try to arrange them in systematic order so that every video file is placed in a folder with the same name and with a subtitle file. also there will be 2 log file one with the action taken for a file and other for files without srt files.

To-Do:
- Find what file need renaming.
- Rename those files
- create folders for Videos without parent folder with same name and move them all to same directory
